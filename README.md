APP NAME : IRESCUE

After hearing such deadly cases of deaths due to natural disasters, we have got this golden opportunity to express our views on this topic.
As we found the major lag of any natural disaster rescue team is to pin point exactly were the victims are, and hence there are cases for death due to long rescue time.
The app we are building would help both the victims and the rescue teams.
Salient feature of the app:
•	Track the exact location of the victims so that the rescue team can act more efficiently. This is done with the help of GPS.
•	The app shows necessary contacts of various types of personnel available to so you can tell them your trouble. Say you are enjoying a vacation at Kerala and you don't expect any natural calamity to occur but suddenly flood comes, then instead of getting worried about where to go or wasting time contacting rescue people, you can get all the details at one place.
•	Contains an inbuilt helper sort of an AI which can help you not to panic and tell you what precautions to be taken, and can answer your problems efficiently.
•	Finally, when you are stuck in a disaster and you have this app, the app will automatically send the information about the disaster to the concerned authority, so that they know before hand that something has happened and they can act fast. Say you and 5 other members are stuck in a house while the area has flooded so on opening app and clicking Help button the information of flood can be sent to concerned authority with your location so if any one of the member also have the app then, the rescue operation can be smoothened and be done quickly  
 Platforms
We have used library of javascript, Android studio and many more things to built this app
